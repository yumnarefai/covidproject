Project CSC110: Covid In The Air

We derived the database from Kaggle and modified the dataset to only take in the first 100 entries of data for our visualizations and analytical reasoning.

We used libraries such as matplotlib, numpy, panda etc. to generate the corresponding visualisations such as pie charts, linear regression models and bar charts to determine the trend in pollutant gases in each industry in China.

We also analysed these models to determine whether Covid 19 played a significant role in changing the emission and production of pollutant gases. The insights were fully analysed in the latex report.
